## My process

Figure out the basic structure and then build from the outside in, thinking responsively.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I relearned how great flexbox is for positioning elements that are lined up and nicely spaced. I also learned how to speed up as I had limited time to do this.

### Continued development

I'd like to get better at determining what would be an id versus a class, using utility classes, and then not repeating styles.
